These days I am trying my best effort to adapt to the new environment. A lot of things need to learn, a lot of people need to know.

During this period, I read a number of articles. Some of them are really good ones and worth to record here.

## git

Most of my spare time is spending on reading git related articles, which is well worth. After a lot of reading, finally, I got agreed with the point of view that we should "Commit Often, Perfect Later, Publish Once".

1 [Commit Often, Perfect Later, Publish Once: Git Best Practices](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/)

Git is amazing for its free branching, so we'd better make use of this. After learning from the article below, we could become a guru in git branch technology.

At last, there is a very cool site, where we could find some really good tutorials and articles about git.

## linux performance

There are many very useful tools in linux. I have a chance to use several of them during the work, like: strace, ltrace, pdb, etc.

Above is a detailed "Linux Performance Observability Tools" diagram, from here:

## unit test

Before joining this team, I seldom wrote unit tests. So there are lots of things I need to catch up. There are two articles about BDD test:

## timing and profiling

When I tried to analyze my python code, these tools (lprun, mprun, timeit, etc) in IPython help a lot.

That's all.
